# recipe_tracker
CS157A project: Recipe tracker app with tkinter and mysql

Instructions to run:

1. SETUP THE DB
Run the recipedb.sql script to create the recipedata database, either through commandline client, or through workbench.
Ensure that you are using the recipedata database and that all tables are created.
in the DButil.py file, put your password for your local instance of root, under password = "".

2. SAVED_IMAGES
If you have run the code before and have reset your database by running the recipedb.sql script again, make sure that the saved_images directory is empty. 

Run the app.py file to launch the application. 
A folder called test_images has been added to test adding recipes and images.
